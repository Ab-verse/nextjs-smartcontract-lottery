# Hardhat Lottery

The Lottery Smart Contract is a Solidity-based Ethereum contract that allows users to participate in a lottery with a chance to win prizes based on random numbers generated by Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and utilizes Keeper Network compatibility for periodic upkeep.

## Features

- Users can enter the lottery by sending Ether.
- Random winners are selected using Chainlink VRF.
- Periodic raffle runs based on time intervals.
- Keeper Network compatibility ensures the contract's continuous operation.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this contract, you need to:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 
    - You'll know you did it right if you can run ```git --version``` and you see a response like ```git version x.x.x```
  
2. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - ```node --version``` and get an ouput like: ```vx.x.x```

3. [Npm] (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
    - You'll know you've installed npm right if you can run:
        - npm ```--version``` and get an output like: ```x.x.x```
        
3. Set up Chainlink VRF with the required configuration.
